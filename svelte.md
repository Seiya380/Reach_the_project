I'm actually do the tutorial from the framework svelte.

It seems that CSS is separated for each component.

It seems that we can use html string with {@html string} on the variable string.

<p>{@html string}</p>

I now being in advanced of the tutorial.

I have a statement for the logic $state.

Ok everything is quite predictible but probably not as I expected soon.
